    "messageGoal": "I'm a highly motivated technical leader with a focus on Information Technology. As a senior product manager, project manager, business analyst, and solutions architect, my experience empowers me to define processes and best practices to create efficiencies and synergies within teams and the product life cycle. My goal is to coach teams to successfully deliver products through strategic guidance, agility, and continuous improvement.",
    "messagePassion": "Music has played a huge role in my life. As a classically trained pianist I have transferred those skills to electronic dance music production. During my off time I like to build computer keyboards, work on home improvement and home automation projects, hone my software development skills, manage a complex computer network, and work on my car. I have been blessed with a family that loves travelling and so I like to explore new destinations every year to decompress from work.",
    "messageHeritage": "I was born and raised in Romania but have lived in the United States with my family since I was 14. The journey of coming to this great country has impressed upon me and my values the sacrifices that my parents have endured to give me a better future. My focus and drive are a testament to those who came before me, and hopefully an inspiration to the people in my life today, and my kids sometime in the future."
